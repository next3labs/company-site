      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We're a Singapore-based technology company that does two things really well: building custom software and rescuing Linux servers.</p>
      <p>No corporate fluff. No buzzword bingo. Just solid technical work delivered by people who actually know what they're doing.</p>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p><strong>Code should work.</strong> We write clean, tested, maintainable code that solves real problems. No shortcuts, no tech debt bombs.</p>
      <p><strong>Speed matters.</strong> When your server is down, every minute counts. We respond fast and fix things right.</p>
      <p><strong>Honesty is non-negotiable.</strong> If we can't help, we'll tell you. If there's a better solution, we'll recommend it even if it's not us.</p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>We're a small team that prefers direct communication and practical solutions. No account managers, no endless meetings, just engineers talking to engineers.</p>
      <p>Based in Singapore, we work with clients locally and internationally. Remote work is our default mode, but we're happy to meet in person if you're in town.</p>
